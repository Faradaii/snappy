This application was developed using Git, GitHub, Android Studio, and Flutter as the primary framework.

## Challenges - Solutions - Impact

The development of this application faced several challenges, including managing state on each page, interacting with APIs, implementing clean architecture, integrating API data with Google Maps, implementing build variants, and localization.

### Challenges

- Interacting with APIs and displaying data from them.
- Uploading photos from the camera and gallery and performing image cropping.
- Creating build variants to introduce premium features.
- Integrating Google Maps into the application.
- Building scalable and maintainable code for future development.
- Implementing localization to support multiple languages.

### Solutions

- Using the `http` dependency for API interactions.
- Using the `bloc` dependency for state management to keep the UI consistent.
- Using the `intl` and `flutter_localizations` dependencies to support localization.
- Implementing build flavors to divide the app into two versions (free and premium).
- Using the `image_picker`, `hl_image_picker`, and `image` dependencies to support image capturing and cropping.
- Using the `go_router` dependency for routing and implementing dependency injection with `get_it`.
- Using the `google_maps_flutter` and `geocoding` dependencies to manipulate maps in the app.

### Impact

- The application requires an internet connection as data is not stored in a local database.
- The application presents stories effectively, and some stories can display their locations.
- Users can upload stories with location data if they are using the premium version.
- The application allows users to crop images before uploading them.
- The application's language can be changed, supporting four languages (Bahasa Indonesia, English, Korean, Chinese).

## Lesson Learned

From this project, I learned how to use Flutter as an application framework. This application taught me how to interact with APIs, use state management, implement routing and dependency injection, and create build variants.

- Improved my understanding of Flutter.
- Helped me understand API interactions.
- Helped me understand state management using `bloc`, routing with `go_router`, and dependency injection with `get_it`.
- Helped me understand build flavors and build variants in app development.
- Helped me understand multi-language localization.
- Helped me understand how to use Google Maps in Flutter.
